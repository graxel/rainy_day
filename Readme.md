###Does rain affect public transit ridership?

Here in San Francisco, it tends to rain about 4 months of the year, starting around mid-November, and then clearing up sometime in March. Being in the middle of the rainy season, it got me thinking: 

**Does the weather affect ridership on public transportation? If so, in what ways?**

To tackle this problem, I needed to obtain two datasets, the daily ridership and weather records for each city I looked at.  I figured weather data would be easy to obtain, that the scope of my project would be limited by the cities for which I could find historical ridership data. ![]()
